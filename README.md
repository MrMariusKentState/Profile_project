<h1>Election Map Project</h1>
<p>This website consists of a user-friendly clickable U.S. map where a user can click on any given state and retrieve voter data from the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.  The backend is built with Python and Flask, and the frontend design incorporates the use of Bootstrap and Jinja2. </p>
<h3>Current Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>An image of a clickable U.S. map consisting of set html coordinates linked to specific U.S. state locations, which then renders a page with election results unique to the clicked U.S. state.
<li>U.S. State Electoral and Popular voting data retrieved from MySQL database, which is linked by U.S. state id. 
<li>Incorporated Bootstrap grid system and unique color stylings for rendering data
</ul>
<h3>Potential Future Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate Google and AJAX APIs to render line graphs illustrating voter trends for Republican and Democratic presidential candidates for every presidential election since 2000.
<li>Incorporate clickable map to efficiently retrieve presidential election data on a county level (map would be refined).
  </ul>
